## **About:**

This repository includes the press release dataset used for my and Dr. Patrick D. Tucker's paper [How Partisanship Influences What Congress Says Online and How They Say It](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1532673X20939498). This dataset is dedicated to the faculty at Washington University in St. Louis.

## **Press Releases:** 

Note: Since house.gov and senate.gov pages are retired once the respective member leaves office (i.e. retirement, resignation, promotion, or death), press releases by members who were not serving at the time of the web scraping (March 2019) were not collected.

#### **109_to_115:** 

Press releases for members of Congress serving continuously between the 109th session and 115th session of Congress. Per the note above, members of this list must also be currently in office.

#### **2014_close_elections:** 

Press releases for members of Congress who were elected in 2014 in a close election (i.e. winning with a vote margin of 5% or less). Since several members elected under a close election in 2014 subsequently lost reelection, and since the population size for the Close Elections Data Set is relatively small, we retrieved press releases from former MCs in this set using the Internet Archive’s [“Wayback Machine.”](https://archive.org/web/)

#### **2014_newly_elected:** 

Press releases for members of Congress who were newly elected to office in 2014. Members who had previously served as a US Representative or Senator (i.e. an individual elected to the Senate in 2014 who had previsouly served as a US Representative) were excluded as they do not appropriately represent the sample group.

#### **2018_retired_members:**

Press releases for members of Congress who served from 109th to 115th sessions and chose not to run for reelection in 2018.
